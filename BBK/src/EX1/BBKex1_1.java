this is the answer for ex 1 of the OODP class - in this i am going to be using the switch and case 'system'
the switch case system is 
the switch option gives you the option to test a range of values for your variables - this is less conplicated then using the 
"if ..... else is statements..."" 
The strusture of the switch statement is as follows:

switch (variable to test){
  case value:
         code_here;
         break;
  case value:
         code_here;
         break;
  default:
       values_not_caught_above;

}
